The previous AI engineer performed extensive iterative development on the  clone, driven largely by manual QA from the user, which exposed flaws in automated testing. The process introduced the Deployment-First Validation Lens after a critical 502 production failure due to relying only on local testing. Key achievements include transforming the aesthetic to a consistent professional dark theme, implementing major features like a 5-slide Hero Carousel, an Animated Partners Strip (with reduced size and continuous scroll), a Stats Bar, and full PWA enablement with a mobile-only splash screen for immediate service contact. Crucially, the architecture was just overhauled from a Next.js 14 monolith to a **React/Vite Frontend** and a nascent **FastAPI Backend** to satisfy specific Kubernetes deployment expectations. The last completed action was updating the core contact email from  to  across the new frontend components and preparing for a pre-deployment health check of the new split architecture.

<product_requirements>
The primary goal is to create a superior, production-ready Progressive Web App (PWA) clone of  that reflects the brand's elite security services with exceptional attention to detail.

**Key Requirements & Status:**
1.  **Professional Dark Theme**: The entire site (Header, Hero, Stats Bar, Partners Strip, Testimonials, Values, Team) must maintain a sophisticated, dark theme with excellent contrast and readability. (ACHIEVED)
2.  **High-Fidelity Clone**: Match the original site's depth, including elite positioning content (e.g., 20+ years experience, K9, TSCM) and professional leadership team details. (ACHIEVED)
3.  **Dynamic Homepage**: Implement a 5-slide auto-rotating Hero Carousel, a Stats Bar with company metrics (152% growth, 50+ agents), and an Animated Partners Strip (single-line, continuous scroll). (ACHIEVED)
4.  **PWA & Mobile UX**: Enable PWA features (Service Worker, Manifest) and implement a mobile-only splash screen upon first visit with options to Contact Us Now (pre-filled email to ) or Proceed to App. (ACHIEVED)
5.  **Contact & Compliance**: Ensure all contact mechanisms, including the form API route and mailto links, target the correct, updated email address (). A functional Privacy Policy page must be present. (EMAIL UPDATED; POLICY PAGE CREATED).
6.  **Architectural Compliance**: The final structure must support the deployment system's expectation of a separate  and  architecture. (CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTING/MIGRATING).
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Architectural Shift**: Migration from Next.js 14 monolith (App Router) to React/Vite Frontend + FastAPI Backend.
- **PWA Implementation**: Use of Service Workers, Manifest, and custom React components (, ).
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom global styles for dark theme and CSS animations (e.g., logo scroll).
- **Interactivity**: Implementation of custom components for carousel, stats, and animated logos.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The project underwent a massive architectural restructuring from a Next.js App Router structure to a standard monorepo structure with a separate frontend and backend, driven by deployment system requirements.



-   ****: Sets up the core React application using React Router to handle page navigation (Home, About, Services, Contact, Privacy).
-   ****: Contains the primary structure for the homepage, integrating , , and .
-   ****: Crucial component for the animated logo carousel. It was updated to be half the size, use a dark background, and implement continuous right-to-left scrolling animation.
-   ****: Implements the mobile-only splash screen logic, including the logic for immediate email contact via .
-   ****: Centralized definitions for team members (now correct full names and titles), services, and testimonials. This file was recently modified to update all  references to .
-   ****: Minimal FastAPI entry point created to satisfy the deployment system, currently empty of business logic.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Complete the migration and implementation of all API logic (e.g., email sending) into the new FastAPI Backend ().
- Fix the issue where the Privacy Policy page link directs to a missing page or has JavaScript loading issues.
- Implement the auto-playing background video with the Watch overlay on the homepage hero section.
- Conduct a comprehensive pre-deployment health check on the newly restructured React/Vite/FastAPI application.

<current_work>
The immediate preceding work focused on two major efforts:

1.  **Architectural Restructuring**: Due to a 502 deployment error, the Next.js monolithic application was rapidly refactored into a  (React/Vite) and  (FastAPI) split structure. This migration involved translating Next.js App Router patterns to React Router and ensuring component compatibility outside of the Next.js ecosystem. The frontend build is reported as successful, but the backend is currently a shell, and the integration/API calls need to be verified.

2.  **Email Address Update**: The user requested changing the primary contact email. The AI successfully implemented this change:
    *   **Action**: Updated all references of  to .
    *   **Files Affected (Implicitly in new structure)**:  (for centralized config), and all components/pages using the contact info (e.g., , , ).

The current state is highly polished visually (dark theme, carousel, animations, accurate content), functionally refined (PWA, splash screen, corrected navigation), but is currently unstable due to the incomplete architectural migration. The last completed action was the email update, and the next requested action is the health check.

Call the Deployer Agent and Run Health Check to Check for Readiness for Deployment, as explicitly requested by the user.
