## üöÄ Deployment Process

### Production Deployment

The application is configured for **production deployment** with enterprise infrastructure.

**Build Phase:**
```
1. Detect Python app (requirements.txt)
   ‚îî‚îÄ> Install: fastapi, uvicorn, pydantic, python-multipart

2. Copy Python files
   ‚îî‚îÄ> Finds: server.py, app.py at root level

3. Detect Node.js (frontend/package.json)
   ‚îî‚îÄ> Run: yarn install && yarn build

4. Create container image
   ‚îî‚îÄ> Exclude: docs/, agents/, tools/, tests/ (via .slugignore)

5. Configure startup
   ‚îî‚îÄ> Command: uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port ${PORT}
```

**Runtime Phase:**
```
1. Container starts
2. Uvicorn launches FastAPI app
3. Backend serves:
   - API endpoints: /api/*
   - Frontend static: /* (from /app/frontend/dist)
4. Health checks: /api/health
5. Application ready!
```

## üîß Environment Variables

### Required (Must be set in deployment):

```bash
# Backend
MONGO_URL=mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net/copperhead

# Frontend (build-time)
VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://copperheadci.com
VITE_APP_NAME=Copperhead Consulting Inc
VITE_ENVIRONMENT=production
```

### Optional:

```bash
# Analytics
VITE_GA_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
VITE_GTM_ID=GTM-XXXXXXX
```

**Note:** Copy `.env.example` for complete list.

## üìä What Gets Deployed

### ‚úÖ Included:
- Root Python files (server.py, app.py)
- Python dependencies (requirements.txt)
- Frontend build (frontend/dist/)
- Configuration files (Procfile, runtime.txt)
- Essential docs (README.md only)

### ‚ùå Excluded (via .slugignore):
- Documentation (docs/ - 6 files)
- Development tools (agents/, tools/)
- Test files (tests/)
- Development config (.autodev/)
- Log files, PDFs, backups

**Total Deployment Size:** ~15MB (optimized)

---

## üß™ Testing Before Deployment

### Run Smoke Tests:

```bash
# Backend tests
python tests/test_backend.py

# Frontend tests
python tests/test_frontend.py

# All tests (with pytest)
pip install pytest
pytest tests/ -v
```

**Expected Output:**
```
‚úÖ Imports work
‚úÖ FastAPI instance correct
‚úÖ Health endpoint exists
‚úÖ Routes configured
‚úÖ Frontend dist exists
‚úÖ index.html present
‚úÖ Assets built
```

---

## üîç Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Health Check
```bash
curl https://copperheadci.com/api/health
# Expected: {"status":"healthy","service":"copperhead-api"}
```

### 2. Frontend Loads
```bash
curl -I https://your-app.emergent.host/
# Expected: HTTP 200 OK
```

### 3. Static Assets
```bash
# Check if JS bundles load
curl -I https://your-app.emergent.host/assets/index-[hash].js
# Expected: HTTP 200 OK
```

### 4. Contact Form
- Open homepage
- Fill out contact form
- Click submit
- Verify mailto: link opens email client

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Blocked request. This host is not allowed."

**Cause:** Vite host configuration  
**Fix:** Wildcard hosts already configured in `vite.config.ts`
```typescript
preview: {
  host: true,
  allowedHosts: ['.emergentagent.com', '.emergent.host']
}
```

### Issue: Frontend not loading

**Cause:** Backend not serving static files  
**Check:** 
```python
# In server.py, verify:
frontend_dist_path = "/app/frontend/dist"
app.mount("/", StaticFiles(directory=frontend_dist_path, html=True))
```

### Issue: Database connection failed

**Cause:** MONGO_URL not set or incorrect  
**Fix:** Set `MONGO_URL` environment variable in deployment settings

### Issue: Port binding failed

**Cause:** Hardcoded port instead of using $PORT  
**Fix:** Procfile uses `${PORT:-8001}` (already configured)
